I believe that being a good developer means coming up with your own unique solutions, while also learning from those who have blazed the trail before you. Some of the cool things you see on my site are inspired by (or straight up copied from) other developers' really cool code. My Google-foo is strong. I may not have invented some of the ingredients, but I did bake them together into this delicious treat.

I believe that in this digital age, your website can make or break you. An ugly site, especially on mobile, can lose you customers left and right. 

Let me make you something pretty.
